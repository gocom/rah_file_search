h1. rah_file_search

p. Simple public file search; combines the power of an "article":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=article and a "file_download_list":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=file_download_list. Searches matching results from files' descriptions and filenames, and retunes the results as nicely formatted list.
